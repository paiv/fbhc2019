Carlos is hoping to strike it rich with his new consulting firm, Carlos
Structures Industries (CSI). With a solid mission statement and a can-do
attitude, he's sure to succeed in the wide world of bespoke data structures.

"Our vision is to synergistically leverage our core competencies to deliver
competitive market solutions that assertively meet our clients' needs."

His first client, the well-known translation firm Treehouse, is looking to
update their logo. Treehouse wants their logo to be a rooted tree with N nodes
numbered 1 through N. They have a rough idea of what the tree should look like,
but they want Carlos to finish fleshing it out. In particular, they have M
requirements, the ith of which states that the lowest common ancestor of nodes
Xi and Yi must be node Zi.

Carlos's goal is to find any valid tree consistent with all of these
requirements if possible, or to determine that no such tree exists.
